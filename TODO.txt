TODOS FOR THE APP BEFORE SUBMITING:
- Add a Fair-Enough, Optimal , etc... switch to yield better plans?
- If PDDL output doesn't make sense then return a default or error msg and log it.
- If user search for the same Place_ID don't allow to add it.
- Control when user does not click on one of the suggested places to avoid 
 the app to search for all the related ones. like the Pizza use case...
- Limit Search boundaries LONDON
- Also double check to allow only for places which distance is less than "X" meters or "Y" minutes...
- I made the change to compute distances using Place_ID and didn't work.
However, the submit was successful and it shouldn't.
- I found out an example that draws the path!

question that suggests using the Place_id: preffix to get it correctly.

CODE TO DRAW PATHS:
var directionsService = new google.maps.DirectionsService;
var directionsDisplay = new google.maps.DirectionsRenderer;
directionsDisplay.setMap(map);
directionsDisplay.setOptions({markerOptions:'bla'})

function calculateAndDisplayRoute(directionsService, directionsDisplay) {
        directionsService.route({
          origin: markers[1].placeResult.geometry.location,
          destination: markers[2].placeResult.geometry.location,
          travelMode: 'DRIVING'
        }, function(response, status) {
          if (status === 'OK') {
            directionsDisplay.setDirections(response);
          } else {
            window.alert('Directions request failed due to ' + status);
          }
        });
      }

calculateAndDisplayRoute(directionsService,directionsDisplay);

Constraints in planning:
http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/dvm/papers/pddl-ipc5.pdf


NOTES AMANDA
add at 900 in the morning and then delete it at 
time initial LITERAL
conditional to every action
los time literals es lo de AT open at not open .... ojo
awake person , not awake person.
o back to the hotel at this time 
is "not-bed-time"...
also a preference.
-Like TFL PLANNER NO WALK MORE THAN xxx
- DISABLE ACCESS
USEFUL TIPS FOR REPORT:
 how the planner scales
 experiments i did
 ideas for the module
 user change the plan to spend more time
 interesting question replan and reuse the plan
 replaning instead of creating the plan from scratch
 intro why project is good, how many users come to london etc.
 planners 
 makesure papers on planners why use those planners, etc

THESE ARE THE SECTIONS (need to ask for more):
###literature review
###specification and design...
some technical reason why python was good not onlt one reason!!! a lot

diagrams of the system.

also ask amanda about all the SECTIONS
say about testing.. .how I did it ...
###evaluation ...
scalability of the planner 
features that im uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
###conclusions
abstraction inside pddl with google maps.
showcase ability of the planner. for people not used to it.
future work

##future scalable rewards tate modern 1 hour instead of 2 because is better for the overall plan.
