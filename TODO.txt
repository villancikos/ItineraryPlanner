TODOS FOR THE APP BEFORE SUBMITING:

- If user search for the same Place_ID don't allow to add it.
- Control when user does not click on one of the suggested places to avoid 
 the app to search for all the related ones. like the Pizza use case...
- Search boundaries LONDON
- I made the change to compute distances using Place_ID and didn't work.
However, the submit was successfull and it shouldn't.
- I found out an example that draws the path!
